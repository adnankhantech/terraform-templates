#### Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

If you're new to Terraform and want to get started creating infrastructure, please check out [Getting Started](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) guides on HashiCorp's learning platform.

This repository will have terraform templates for setting up infrastructure on AWS services to begin with using EC2, S3, AMI, Security Group, VPC, RDS.
